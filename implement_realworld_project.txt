Sure, here's an example project that illustrates how the steps outlined in my first response can be applied in a real-world scenario:

Project: Deploying a web application on a Linux-based server

Learn Linux basics: In this project, you'll need to have a good understanding of Linux commands and file systems to be able to navigate and manage the server. For example, you should be able to create and edit files, change permissions, and view logs to troubleshoot issues.

Learn a programming language: You'll need to know a scripting language like Bash to write scripts that automate tasks on the server. For example, you could write a Bash script to automatically deploy a new version of the application.

Familiarize yourself with version control: Using Git to manage the code for the web application is a best practice. You should be able to clone the repository, checkout different branches, and merge changes.

Learn configuration management tools: Ansible is a popular configuration management tool that you can use to manage the server's configuration. You should be able to write Ansible playbooks to automate tasks like installing dependencies, configuring the web server, and setting up the database.

Understand containerization: Docker is a popular tool for containerization. You can use it to package the web application and its dependencies into a container that can be deployed on the server.

Learn about continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD): Jenkins is a popular CI/CD tool that can be used to automate the deployment process. You should be able to configure Jenkins to build the application, run tests, and deploy it to the server.

Gain cloud experience: In this project, you could deploy the web application on a cloud server like AWS EC2 or Google Compute Engine. You should be able to create and manage instances, configure security groups, and set up load balancing.

Practice automation: You can automate tasks like deploying the web application, setting up the server, and monitoring logs. For example, you could write a Bash script that automatically deploys a new version of the application when changes are pushed to the Git repository.

Build a personal project: To demonstrate your skills, you could build a simple web application and deploy it on a cloud server using the tools and practices you've learned.

Join a community: There are many online communities for DevOps professionals, like the DevOps subreddit or the DevOps community on LinkedIn. You can join these communities to stay up-to-date with industry trends, learn from others, and network with potential employers.

By following these steps, you can successfully deploy a web application on a Linux-based server using best practices and automation.
