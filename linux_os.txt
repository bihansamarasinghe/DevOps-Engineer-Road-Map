To become a DevOps engineer, it's important to have a good understanding of Linux basics, as most DevOps practices are built on top of Linux-based operating systems. Understanding the basic commands, file systems, processes, and permissions in Linux will enable you to work more efficiently and effectively in a DevOps environment.

You should be familiar with the Linux command line, and be able to navigate, create, move, copy, and delete files and directories. You should also have a basic understanding of Linux system administration tasks, such as managing users, permissions, services, and packages.

Having a strong foundation in Linux will make it easier to learn and work with other DevOps tools and technologies, as they often rely on Linux-based systems for their operation. While it's possible to work in DevOps without being a Linux expert, having a good understanding of Linux will certainly give you an advantage in the field.
